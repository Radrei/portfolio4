			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr class="hr-large" />
			<p>My name is Brittany and I make websites. I love getting lost in code because it makes the time fly. I have a degree in Web Development and I am continually updating my skills and learning more. I enjoy working in HTML and CSS the most, but also work with JavaScript, jQuery, and Wordpress. I am highly proficient, efficient, and always meet deadlines. I am fortunate to have been able to work for people that share my passion and appreciate my dedication.  It is my goal to continue to gain knowledge in my field and expand my skills as much as possible. </p>
